# BetterBedrock

This is a standalone plugin for pocketmine, it is only for creating proxy servers for console players (but other players can connect to it),
You dont need any other plugins for it to work, just drag it in and you have your proxy.
Simply drag and drop it in to your plugin file and your done.

For the featured server icons to work you will have to place "customicons.zip" in your texture pack folder and list it in "texture_packs.yml".
